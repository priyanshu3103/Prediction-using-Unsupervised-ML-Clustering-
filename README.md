# Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML-Clustering-

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them.

For performing the cluster I use K-means algorithm:
  K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters   that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.It allows us to cluster the data     into different groups and a convenient way to discover the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset by its own without the need for any training.
  
Here, I use Elboe method for finding the cluster after that I was predict the optimum number of clusters
and represent it visually.
